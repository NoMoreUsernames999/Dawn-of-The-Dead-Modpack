This is the bug report template, use it only to submit bugs. If this is a feature suggestion, go back and use the "enhancement" template.
When providing logs, you must close the game right after the bug happens (if it didn't already crash) and move the latest.log file to your desktop. If you start the game up again, the latest.log will be replaced by a new one containing none of the relevant information!

===================================
The title of this submission must be a brief description of the bug to make it easier to find. 
Please provide the requested information (if we ask for versions, do not just say latest!). If you do not, your issue will simply be ignored and closed. You may be asked by a dev to provide additional information. If you do not provide additional information within a reasonable window of time, your issue will also be closed.
