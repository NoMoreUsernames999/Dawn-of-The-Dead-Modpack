This is the suggestion template. It is for suggesting features or gameplay changes, not mods. If you want to suggest a mod, do so through the Discord because it will likely not be accepted save for rare circumstances, and we don't need the issue tracker cluttered. 

===================================
The title of this issue should be a brief description of your suggestion to make it easier to find, with the beginning being the name of a suggestion category inside brackets "[]". See below for the categories. 
Please provide the requested information. If you do not, your issue will simply be ignored and closed. You may be asked by a dev to provide additional information. If you do not provide additional information within a reasonable window of time, your issue will also be closed. 
===================================

Make sure to look at existing suggestions using the search feature so that you don't make duplicate suggestions. 

The different suggestion categories are: 
- Game mechanic: Related to general game mechanics.
- Recipe: Anything related to any kind of crafting or processing recipe.
- Mob: Anything related to mob spawning (minus the invasion feature), mob stats, or mob-planet distribution. 
- Worldgen: Anything related to general world generation.
- Planet: Anything related to planet design or features, as well as suggesting new planets (we rarely accept new planets unless it is relevant to progression and a unique enough design to warrant adding yet another dimension. Only applicable to The Atlas Project modpack).
- Other: Anything that doesn't fit the above categories.
